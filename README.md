This is a clone of my Rails app Flatcasts. Flatcasts was a project for Flatiron School students. The online lectures are unlisted YouTube videos that were shared via a Google Doc. This did not make it very easy for students find a particular lecture. Flatcasts allowed students and the instructors to add the lectures in a searchable format. The videos were able to be watched inside the add using YouTube embedded videos. Flatiron has since moved on to an internal tool for sharing lectures.

I wanted to use my idea as my first Elixir Phoenix project. I have thought of ways to expand my original idea and think it will be a good jumping off point to get my feet wet with Elixir and Phoenix.
