# VideoShare
VideoShare is a platform for organizations to share private YouTube and Vimeo links
with their team. An organization will be able to create an account and invite
members of their team to join the organization. From there, sharing private
YouTube or Vimeo videos with your organization will be as simple as adding the
URL to the video. Your organization will be able to see all of the videos it has
uploaded and watch the embedded video from within the app.
