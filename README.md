# Vidshare

A site for companies to share videos with their team. Sites like Vimeo and Youtube have unlisted videos. These can be viewed by anyone that has the URL. Vidshare will allow you to have all of your teams unlisted videos in one place. These will be searchable and embedded on the site to be viewed from within the application.

No more will you need to have an internal document that is hard to search and make sense of.
